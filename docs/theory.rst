Theory
------

The theory for the models in this software are based directly on the work described in references :cite:`Fingersh2006`. The NREL Cost and Scaling Model :cite:`Fingersh2006` provides a simple cost and sizing tool to estimate wind plant cost of energy based on a small number of input parameters such as rotor diameter, hub height and rated power.  The models here extract the financial calculators for the model only.
